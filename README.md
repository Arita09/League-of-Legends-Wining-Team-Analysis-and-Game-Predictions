# League-of-Legends-Wining-Team-Analysis-and-Game-Predictions
The goal of my project was to predict game result by using machine learning models.

For this project I used Python as main language, and Jupyter Notebook for IDEs; Pandas and Numpy libraries for analysis; Matplotlib, Seaborn and Tableau for visualization; Sklearn for machine learning; and Confusion Matrix from Sklearn to evaluate my models. 


#### The models trained were:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

Notebook #1 - Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis In this notebook, I loaded the raw dataset from the source, conducted data cleaning where applicable, and dived into exploratory data analysis to obtain insights from the data prior to preprocessing and modelling.

Notebook #2 - Preprocessing In this notebook, I loaded the cleaned up and feature engineered dataset from Notebook #1, and transformed it to be model ready.
